## Operation
At startup, the first screen will ask for the number of connected load cells. While this screen is open, it should be safe to plug/unplug load cells. All of the HX711 amplifier are in the powered down state.  
After selecting the number of load cells, it will tear the selected number of load cells. Any unused load cell amplifier will remain in the powered off state.
### Main Screen
The main screen will show the weight from the load cell, and if the number of load cells allows, left/right load balance and front/back load balance. The total weight from adding all the load cells together is then shown.  
Pressing the menu button will go to the calibration menu. Pressing shift will go to the configuration menu. Plus will not do anything on this screen. Pressing minus will tare all the configured load cell.
### Calibration Menu
Use the buttons to select which load cell to calibrate. Note, you will only be able to select a load cell that has been enabled through the configuration menu. If you want to cancel the calibration, on the 'Starting Calibration' screen, press the menu button to return to the main screen. To continue, press the minus button to tear. While tearing there should be no weight on the load cell, or what you would like to read as 0 on the scale. 
After tareing, press menu to continue and start the calibration. Load the load cell with a known mass and enter the value of the mass. Shift will move one digit to the right, Plus will increase by a digit, Minus will decrease by a digit. Press Menu to confirm. You will then be given the option to save the calibration, choose yes or no. If No is selected, the previous calibration value will be retained and you will be returned to the main screen. If yes is selected, the new calibration value will be saved to EEPROM and used immediately.
